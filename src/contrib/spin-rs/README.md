[Documentation](https://mvdnes.github.io/rust-docs/spin-rs/spin/index.html)

This Rust library implements a simple
[spinlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinlock).

Usage
-----

By default this crate only works on nightly but you can disable the default features
if you want to run on stable. Nightly is more efficient than stable currently.

Include the following code in your Cargo.toml

```toml
[dependencies.spin]
version = "0.4"
# If you want to run on stable you will need to add the following:
# default-features = false
```

Example
-------

When calling `lock` on a `Mutex` you will get a reference to the data. When this
reference is dropped, the lock will be unlocked.

```rust
extern crate spin;

fn main()
{
    let mutex   = spin::Mutex::new(0);
    let rw_lock = spin::RwLock::new(0);

    // Modify the data
    {
      let mut data = mutex.lock();
      *data = 2;
      let mut data = rw_lock.write();
      *data = 3;
    }

    // Read the data
    let answer =
    {
      let data1 = mutex.lock();
      let data2 = rw_lock.read();
      let data3 = rw_lock.read(); // sharing
      (*data1, *data2, *data3)
    };

    println!("Answers are {:?}", answer);
}
```

To share the lock, an `Arc<Mutex<T>>` may be used.

Remarks
-------

The behaviour of these lock is similar to their namesakes in `std::sync`. they
differ on the following:

 - The lock will not be poisoned in case of failure;

 Forked by Chris Williams (diosix.org) to implement compare_and_swap() for atomics, which is disabled in the RISC-V Rust toolchain.
