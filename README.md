### Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

Diosix 2.0 strives to be a lightweight, fast, and secure multiprocessor bare-metal hypervisor written [in Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for 32-bit and 64-bit [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) computers. A long-term goal is to build open-source Diosix packages that configure FPGAs with custom RISC-V cores and peripheral controllers to accelerate specific tasks, on the fly if necessary. This software should also run on supported system-on-chips.

Right now, Diosix is a work in progress. It can bring up a RISC-V system, load a Linux guest OS with minimal filesystem into a virtualized environment called a capsule, and begin executing it. The next step is to provide the guest a Device Tree Blob describing its virtualized environment so that it can successfully boot.

### Quickstart <a name="quickstart"></a>

You can run Diosix in a convenient containerized environment. These instructions assume you are comfortable using Docker and the command-line interface on a Linux-like system.

First, you must authenticate with the GitHub Packages system. If you have not yet done so, [create a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) that grants read-only access to GitHub Packages, and [pass this token](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-docker-for-use-with-github-packages#authenticating-to-github-packages) to Docker.

Then, fetch the Docker container image of the [latest release](https://github.com/diodesign/diosix/releases) from GitHub:

```
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/diodesign/diosix/wip:prealpha-dtb-safe-parse1
```

Next, use the image to boot Diosix within a temporary container using the Qemu emulator:

```
docker run --rm docker.pkg.github.com/diodesign/diosix/wip:prealpha-dtb-safe-parse1 cargo run
```

The output should appear similar to the following, indicating Diosix running on a quad-core 64-bit RISC-V machine with 512MiB of RAM:

Press `Control-c` to exit.

### Build a container environment <a name="container"></a>

If you do not want to use GitHub Packages, you can build the container environment from the Diosix source code. Navigate to a suitable directory, and use these commands to fetch, build, and run a Docker contaimer tagged `diosix:testenv`:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/diodesign/diosix.git
cd diosix
docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag diosix:testenv
docker run --rm diosix:testenv cargo run
```

Press `Control-c` to exit. To start the hypervisor within an interactive debugging environment, add `-ti` after `docker run --rm`, eg:

```
docker run --rm -ti diosix:testenv cargo run
```

Press `Control-a` then `c` to enter Qemuâ€™s debugging monitor. Run the monitor command `info registers -a` to list the CPU core states. Use `quit` to end the emulation and the container. Instructions on how to use Qemu's monitor [are here](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/monitor.html).

### Build from scratch <a name="fromscratch"></a>

To build and run Diosix completely from scratch, without any containerization, follow use these steps:

1. [Building the toolchain](docs/toolchain.md)
1. [Using Buildroot to build a bootable Linux guest OS](docs/buildroot.md)
1. [Building and using Qemu to test the hypervisor](docs/qemu.md)
1. [Building and running the hypervisor](docs/building.md)
