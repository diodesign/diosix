# diosix

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/diodesign/diosix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/diodesign/diosix)

This is a lightweight and secure multiprocessor microkernel operating system written in Rust for 32-bit and 64-bit RISC-V systems.

It is a work in progress: I'm starting from scratch after [previously writing](https://github.com/diodesign/diosix-legacy)
a working microkernel for 32-bit SMP x86 computers in C and assembly.

I learned a lot from that first iteration, and this is the second iteration of diosix. Crucially,
it will be written [in Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a C/C++-like programming language that has a fierce emphasis
on guaranteed memory safety, threads without data races, and other security features. I chose [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) because it's interesting new ground to explore, whereas there are countless x86 and Arm operating system kernels out there.

### Dependencies

If you're building for a 32-bit RISC-V system, make sure you've cross-compiled and installed the latest RISC-V port (v2.30) of [GNU binutils](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb) as the kernel requires this toolkit to build. Then, you'll need to use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to install the `nightly` toolchain of Rust. The default target must be the build host's architecture (likely x86_64) and you must install the `riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf` target, too. (Currently, Rust only supports 32-bit RISC-V.)

Here's a list of steps to create your RISC-V Rust cross-compiler toolchain on a Debian-like system, which I recommend running in a container or virtual machine to avoid polluting your main environment:

`sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install flex bison m4 sed texinfo
mkdir $HOME/cross
mkdir $HOME/src
cd $HOME/src
git clone -b riscv-binutils-2.30 https://github.com/riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb.git
cd riscv-binutils-gdb
./configure --prefix $HOME/cross --target=riscv32-elf
make
make install
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly
rustup target install riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf`

Make sure your paths are set up to find Rust and Cargo â€“ I use this in my `~/.bashrc`:

`source $HOME/.cargo/env
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/cross/bin`

Then you should be ready to clone `diosix`...

`cd $HOME/src
git clone https://github.com/diodesign/diosix.git
cd diosix`

...and follow the instructions below to build and run it.

### Building and running

You must use the supplied `build.sh` script, which sets up Cargo to compile, assemble, and link the project. Its syntax is:

`./build.sh --triple [build triple] --platform [target platform]`

Supported triples and platforms are listed in the file. The kernel executable can be found in `target/triple/release/kernel` for the given build triple. For example,

`./build.sh --triple riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf --platform sifive_e`

...will build for a 32-bit RISC-V CPU on a SiFive E-series system. Then you can try running it using Qemu:

`qemu-system-riscv32 -machine sifive_e -kernel target/riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf/release/kernel -nographic`

And a screenshot of that command running, printing "hello, world" to the virtual serial port:

### Branches

All current development work is done in `master` and targets RISC-V. The `x86` branch holds an early port of the Rust microkernel for Intel-compatible PC systems. The `x86hypervisor` branch holds an early attempt to build hypervisor features into the `x86` branch. You're welcome to update these so they catch up with `master`, however my focus will be on the RISC-V port.
