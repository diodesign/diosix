## Reporting security issues

The [Diosix](https://diosix.org) project takes security bugs extremely seriously. Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are very much appreciated, and every effort will be made to acknowledge your contributions. To privately report a security issue, email the project lead, and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

The project's maintainers will send a response as soon as possible indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the team will keep you informed of the project's progress toward a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
